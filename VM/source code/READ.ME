The assembler was written in Python so there is no building needed.
To execute the assembler, put the .asm file in the same folder as the assembler, and execute the following command line in your terminal:
$python .\vm_translator.py \filename.vm

-> output = filename.asm in the same <file_folder>

After making the .asm file, use the assembler to create the .hack file:
$python .\assembler.py .\filename.asm

-> output = filename.hack

All .hack file are compiled in the their corresponding folder.
