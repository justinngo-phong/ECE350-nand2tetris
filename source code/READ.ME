assembler.py by Justin Ngo
11/10/2022

The assembler was written in Python so there is no building needed.
To execute the assembler, put the .asm file in the same folder as the assembler, and execute the following command line in your terminal:
$python .\assembler.py .\<filename>.asm

Make sure to go to your current folder in your terminal to execute the assembler.
